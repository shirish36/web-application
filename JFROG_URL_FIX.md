# 🔧 JFrog Configuration Fix

## ❌ The Issue
Your pipeline failed because the `JF_URL` secret doesn't include the protocol (`https://`). The error was:
```
Get "api/system/version": unsupported protocol scheme ""
```

## ✅ The Solution
I've updated both workflows to automatically add `https://` to your `JF_URL` secret.

## 🔍 Your Current JFrog Secrets Should Be:

### ✅ Correct Configuration
| Secret Name | Secret Value |
|-------------|--------------|
| `JF_URL` | `trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io` (without https://) |
| `JF_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Your JFrog access token |

### ❌ Don't Change Your Secrets
Your current secrets are fine! The workflows now automatically add `https://` prefix.

## 🚀 Test the Fix

Since I've updated the workflows, let's test again:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix JFrog URL protocol issue"
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 What Changed in the Workflows

### Before:
```yaml
env:
  JF_URL: ${{ secrets.JF_URL }}
```

### After:
```yaml
env:
  JF_URL: https://${{ secrets.JF_URL }}
```

This ensures the JFrog CLI gets a properly formatted URL like `https://trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io` instead of just `trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io`.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Commit the fix** (run the git commands above)
2. **Monitor the pipeline** at: https://github.com/shirish36/web-application/actions
3. **Stage 1 should now complete successfully** and trigger Stage 2
4. **Complete your WIF setup** to enable Stages 2 & 3

## 🔧 If You Still Have Issues

If you see any other JFrog connection issues, verify:

1. **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN is valid**: Check in JFrog console
2. **Repository name is correct**: Should be `shirish-docker`
3. **Token has proper permissions**: Should have read/write access to the repository

Your pipeline should now work correctly! 🎉
