# 🔧 JFrog URL Fix - Double HTTPS Issue Resolved

## 🚨 **Issue**: Double HTTPS in JFrog URL

### **Problem Identified**
The pipeline was failing with this error:
```
Get "https://https//trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/system/ping": 
dial tcp: lookup https on 127.0.0.53:53: server misbehaving
```

**Root Cause**: The JF_URL secret already contains `https://`, but the workflow was adding another `https://` prefix, resulting in:
- Expected: `https://trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io`
- Actual: `https://https//trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io` ❌

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **Fixed Workflows:**
1. **stage1-build-jfrog.yml** - Removed extra `https://` prefix
2. **stage2-jfrog-to-gcr.yml** - Removed extra `https://` prefix

### **Before Fix:**
```yaml
env:
  JF_URL: https://${{ secrets.JF_URL }}  # ❌ Double https://
```

### **After Fix:**
```yaml
env:
  JF_URL: ${{ secrets.JF_URL }}  # ✅ Correct format
```

## 📋 **GitHub Secrets Configuration**

Your GitHub secrets should be configured as:

### **JF_URL Secret:**
- **Name**: `JF_URL`
- **Value**: `https://trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io` ✅ (includes https://)

### **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN Secret:**
- **Name**: `JF_ACCESS_TOKEN`  
- **Value**: `[Your JFrog access token]`

## 🎯 **Expected Pipeline Behavior**

After this fix, your **Stage 1** will:
1. ✅ Pass quality gates (already working)
2. ✅ Connect to JFrog Artifactory successfully  
3. ✅ Build and push Docker image
4. ✅ Trigger Stage 2 automatically

## 🔍 **Verification**

To verify your JF_URL secret is correct:
1. Go to: https://github.com/shirish36/web-application/settings/secrets/actions
2. Check that `JF_URL` contains: `https://trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io`
3. Ensure there's no extra `https://` prefix

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and push** this fix
2. **Monitor pipeline** - Stage 1 should now complete successfully
3. **Prepare for Stage 2** - Will run once Stage 1 succeeds
4. **Complete WIF setup** for full end-to-end deployment
