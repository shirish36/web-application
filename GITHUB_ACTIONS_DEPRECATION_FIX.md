# 🔄 GitHub Actions Deprecation Fix

## 🚨 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Pipeline failing due to deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
**Error Message**: "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`"

## ✅ Actions Taken

### 1. **Updated Deprecated Actions**
- ✅ `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

### 2. **Cleaned Up Old Workflow Files**
Removed deprecated workflow files that were no longer needed:
- ❌ `build.yml` (contained `actions/checkout@v2`)
- ❌ `build-and-deploy.yml` 
- ❌ `ci-cd-pipeline.yml`
- ❌ `pr-validation.yml`

### 3. **Current Active Workflows** 
✅ **3-Stage Pipeline** (all using latest action versions):
- `stage1-build-jfrog.yml` - Build & Quality Gates
- `stage2-jfrog-to-gcr.yml` - JFrog to GCR Transfer  
- `stage3-deploy-cloud-run.yml` - Cloud Run Deployment
